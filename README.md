# Kerr-Geodesics-in-Terms-of-Weierstrass-Elliptic-Functions
provides  general solutions of the Kerr geodesic equations in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. It contains an implementation of  all functions presented in Ref. X.

## Use in Mathematica

To use the library in Mathematica, put the KerrEqOfMotGeneral.wl package file in the same place as the notebook you are working on. In your notebook, type and upload the following two commands:
	SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];
  	<< "KerrEqOfMotGeneral.wl";
  
Check the Demo.nb to see how to use the basic functions of the package.
